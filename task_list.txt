COMPLETED BUT UNTESTED
fix subscription data t so that it uses generic memory and force using functions to utilize memcpy and casting to access the data.
Allocate at least 128 bits for ipv6 address, or more.

Recent changes should work on Rime and UIP

having the fake sensor create more data

 have the device support mode changes with the press of the buttons.

 need to update vitalprop seq variable with uip_htons to fix byte ordering.

create demo process for gathering basic vitals every 10 seconds and saving them to buffer
use subscription to broadcast packet or update vplist of vitalprop. Default
mode will broadcast or vitalprop a ripplecomm message, but a specific
unicast recipient could be made in place of the general broadcast.

reserving second bit for device status






INCOMPLETE

execute subscription callbacks could return an integer indicating if there are any subscriptions still in the list, allowing the sensors to be shutdown.

create vitalprop border router










COMPLETED
demonstrate control of subscription list based on unicast subscription request.


verify tat vitalprop can use rimeaddr_t for device id in uip mode,
instead of link local address.
